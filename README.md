# CLI Who Wants To Be A Millionaire

CLI Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is a Python command line trivia game based on the TV show of the same name. 

## Design Process

### UX Design Process

### Game Design
- Here is the flowchart that I used to plan out the logic of the game to help me when writing the game code. 

## Features
### Existing Features
- The game features 15 questions.

- There are three lifelines in the game:
	- 50:50
	- Phone a Friend
	- Ask the audience


### Features Left to Implement
- Autosave and saving game progress. If a user leaves the website in the middle of a game their progress will have been saved to local storage.
- The time taken for a user to complete the game will also be recorded, allowing for ranking of the quickest games played. This will add another competitive elemtn to the game.
- Global scoreboard that ranks users on how many questions they answered and how quickly.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Sheets
- Google API 

## Tools used
- For writing code I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I also for Git commands and pushing to GitHub

- [GitHub](https://github.com]) was used for hosting the online repository, it provides an online version of Git, a source code management tool.

- [Markdown Editor](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/markdown-editor/id1458220908?mt=12) by Satoshi Iwaki was used for editing .MD files.


## Testing

- For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.
